# WYZARD SURVIVORS

Test project that uses [OkapiKit], a no-code framework developed for educational purposes at Lusofona University.

It's a ripoff of Vampire Survivors and the objective is to demonstrate the functionality of [OkapiKit] on workshops.

Any suggestions of things that might be covered in the future are welcome!
If you want to do make improvements yourself, let me know what's the results after!

NOTE: we know Wyzard is spelled "Wizard", but the character here is not a wizard, he's a wyzard!
